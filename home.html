        <h2>Livestock Initiative</h2>
        <p>
          Livestock has traditionally been an integral component of the hill farming system in Uttarakhand, contributing
          significantly to the rural economy through household income, family nutrition, biomass production, and draught
          power for agricultural activities. For many rural households, especially marginal farmers, livestock serves as
          the primary source of income. However, the productivity of milch animals in the central and western Himalayan
          regions remains low due to limited availability of high-quality green fodder. Additional challenges such as
          non-descript animal breeds, traditional feeding practices, and inadequate infrastructure for animal health,
          feed, and milk marketing have made animal husbandry unprofitable, leading to male migration and increased
          workloads for women. To address these issues, the Tata Trusts and Himmotthan Society launched the Integrated
          Fodder and Livestock Development Program in 2008, concluding its first two three-year phases by 2014. Building
          on the program’s success, it was scaled up in 2015 into the Central Himalayan Livestock Initiative, which is
          now active in over 650 villages across 10 districts of Uttarakhand and one in Himachal Pradesh, forming 30
          project clusters. This initiative, in collaboration with state departments like the Uttarakhand Livestock
          Development Board, Animal Husbandry Department, Rural Development Department, the International Livestock
          Research Institute (ILRI), and various non-profits, aims to holistically address challenges in the livestock
          sector. The project targets reaching 35,000 households in 700 villages, and has already involved over 33,000
          households in livestock-related interventions.

        <h2>Recycling Campaigns</h2>
        <p>
          Given the distinct ecosystem of the hill regions, agricultural development in the hill districts of
          Uttarakhand requires a tailored approach. Farmers here primarily engage in subsistence agriculture, hindered
          by small and scattered landholdings, difficult terrain, lack of irrigation, limited access to improved inputs
          and technology, and poor credit and marketing facilities. These challenges, compounded by increasing climate
          variability, have adversely affected hill agro-ecosystems. Market development is minimal in high mountain
          regions due to their low contribution to the State’s overall production. Recognizing both the limitations and
          unique opportunities of Uttarakhand’s mountain topography, Himmotthan has implemented key interventions
          through its agriculture program. These include introducing high-yielding varieties and technologies, seed
          production, farm mechanization, establishing Custom Hiring Centers (CHCs), implementing solar lift irrigation
          systems, ensuring input availability through Community Facility Centers (CFCs), training local youth as
          technology disseminators, and building community institutions to support market linkages.To build on earlier
          pilot efforts, Himmotthan launched the ‘Maximizing Mountain Agriculture Project’, funded by The Hans
          Foundation (THF), in 90 villages across 6 clusters in 6 mountain districts, adopting a participatory approach
          involving communities, project partners, government departments, R\&D institutions, and external experts.
          Recognizing the importance of hardy, protein-rich pulses and legumes, which thrive in rainfed, unirrigated
          mountain areas, Himmotthan also initiated ‘Mission Pulses – Uttarakhand’ with support from Tata Trusts to
          develop a sustainable pulse-legume supply chain through community-driven institutions. Post-disaster
          livelihood projects, supported by the Tata Relief Committee and Titan, also focused on agriculture as a core
          component.
          Overall, Himmotthan’s agriculture initiatives have reached 225 villages across 18 clusters in 9 mountain
          districts, involving over 18,000 households in the cultivation, processing, and marketing of pulses, spices,
          high-value crops, and seeds. Key achievements include the cultivation of various crops over 514 acres,
          training of 3,729 farmers in improved agricultural practices, establishment of two solar lift irrigation
          schemes covering 39.9 acres, distribution of 40 farm machines, and setting up of five CHCs managed by farmer
          groups. Additionally, 110 quintals of mountain crop seeds were procured and supplied by cluster-level
          federations, and 27 CFCs, managed by community institutions, conducted business worth ₹1.79 crore, generating
          ₹9.36 lakh in profit.

        <h2>Water and Sanitation Initiative</h2>
        <p>
          ‘Improving Community Health through Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation’ is a flagship initiative under the
          Himmotthan Mountain Program (HMP), aimed at enhancing community health by implementing village-level drinking
          water and environmental sanitation projects with a strong emphasis on hygiene. These projects are managed
          through village-based water and sanitation committees that are responsible for planning, designing,
          implementing, and maintaining their own schemes. From October 2002 to January 2016, three successful phases of
          the initiative covered 133 villages, benefiting 7,000 households and a total of 46,794 people. During this
          period, 218 drinking water schemes, 573 Rain Water Harvesting Structures (RWHSs), and 10,000 sanitation units
          were constructed.

          Himmotthan, under the Tata Water Mission (TWM), continues to advance the WaSH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene)
          initiative, focusing on water security, promotion of point-of-use water treatment, Open Defecation Free (ODF)
          status for villages, School WaSH programs, Behavioural Change Communication (BCC), and collaboration with the
          Swachh Bharat Mission in coordination with the State and Central Governments and Gram Panchayats to ensure
          access to sanitation facilities in remote Himalayan villages. By 2019, the WaSH initiative aimed to reach an
          additional 500 villages, benefiting over 52,000 people.

          Key achievements include the construction of over 200 rural drinking water schemes using a demand-driven,
          participatory approach; the construction and use of more than 10,000 individual household sanitation units;
          creation of WaSH facilities in 215 schools; and support for BCC/IEC activities that contributed to making
          Uttarakhand an ODF State and Mansa District in Punjab ODF as well. Additionally, over 250 springs were treated
          using scientific methods, point-of-use water treatment was scaled up in 100 villages, and a first-of-its-kind
          solar lift drinking water scheme (186 meters single stage) was implemented in 2014, now being replicated in
          other areas. Under the Wise Use of Water (WUW) program, efforts are underway in 200 villages to support
          irrigation needs for agriculture.

        <h2>Education Institution</h2>
        <p>
          Himmotthan has developed a deep understanding of the educational challenges and community needs across the
          Central and Western Himalayan regions. At the core of its strategy is the goal of ensuring quality education
          for all children, particularly those from marginalized backgrounds. The approach goes beyond improving age-
          and grade-appropriate learning in subjects like language and mathematics, to also include fostering
          21st-century skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, collaborative learning, and the use of
          technology. These skills are essential for meaningful participation in a vibrant democracy. Himmotthan also
          emphasizes democratizing education by empowering communities to take ownership of schools and hold
          institutions accountable. Teachers, parents, school management, and students are encouraged to collaborate
          toward shared educational goals.

          With support from Tata Trusts, Himmotthan launched the Education and Sports Initiative (ESI) in February 2020
          across 100 villages in Rudraprayag, Tehri-Garhwal, Dehradun, Bageshwar, and Nainital districts of Uttarakhand.
          The initiative aims to improve learning outcomes in language at the primary level through Early Literacy and
          Library interventions in 85 government schools and School Readiness Programs in 15 Anganwadis. Beyond
          academics, Himmotthan also supports the National Institute of Visually Handicapped (NIVH) in Dehradun to
          promote Blind Sports in India, and it nurtures athletic talent in Uttarakhand through its Middle Distance
          Running program.

          The educational strategy rests on four pillars. **System Strengthening** involves collaborating with state
          authorities to reform educational systems by building Anganwadi capacities, developing standardized learning
          frameworks, and establishing school development indices for feedback. **Deepening Learning** ensures educators
          have access to improved teaching materials and methods, with a focus on age-specific interventions and the
          thoughtful integration of technology. **Broadening Access** includes expanding educational and sports
          opportunities for underserved children through initiatives such as Athletics and Blind Football. **Developing
          Teachers** is central to the mission, with a focus on equipping educators with exposure to best practices and
          professional development to deliver authentic and effective learning experiences for all.

        <h2>Institution and Enterprise</h2>
        <p>
          The livelihoods of rural communities in Uttarakhand’s Central Himalayan region are primarily
          subsistence-based, relying on agriculture, livestock, and forest resources. However, challenges such as small
          and fragmented landholdings, traditional farming practices, degradation of natural resources, inadequate
          infrastructure, limited public services, and the migration of skilled individuals have led to persistent rural
          poverty and restricted livelihood opportunities. Although a network of banks and post offices exists, access
          to formal credit remains limited, particularly in remote villages. In this context, community institutions
          like Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and Federations have proven effective in promoting financial inclusion, allowing
          households to save, access credit, and engage in livelihood activities. Building on this foundation,
          Himmotthan has developed a comprehensive strategy since 2009–10 to empower rural households, especially women,
          by integrating microfinance and community enterprise development. SHGs support credit for enhancing
          productivity, while federations, or Self-Reliant Cooperatives, focus on aggregation, value addition, and
          market linkages. This model also involves capacity building, technical training, and creating a cadre of
          trained rural youth to support both farm and non-farm activities. Currently, the program benefits 87,000
          households across 1,626 villages in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Ladakh, with over 5,000 SHGs and 50
          federations involving 42,000 women. These institutions have collectively mobilized ₹3,585 lakhs in credit and
          achieved a business turnover of ₹3,587 lakhs through micro-dairies, processing units, and community centers.
          Additionally, 1,112 trained youth offer technical support at the village level, and Himmotthan has partnered
          with various government programs for scaling impact. A significant collaboration in 2017 between Tata Trusts,
          Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Strive, and the Government of Uttarakhand led to the launch of a skill-based
          livelihoods initiative across 1,000 villages, focusing on agriculture, livestock, handicrafts, and rural
          marketing. This initiative aims to foster entrepreneurship, self-employment, and collective development under
          Himmotthan’s guidance.

        <h2>Post Disaster Rehabilitation</h2>
        <p>
          The Himalayas have always been vulnerable to the vagaries of many natural disasters like earthquakes due to
          plate tectonic movements, cloudbursts, flash floods, avalanches and landslides. All these natural disasters
          result in bringing the government and various organizations to put in their efforts in coordination for
          immediate relief to the needy and most vulnerable communities both in cash and kind. But after the immediate
          relief work there is a vast vacuum which takes time to be filled and bring the life of the disaster ravaged
          communities back to normal times. Since its initiation Himmotthan has intervened in poverty eradication
          through livestock rearing, mountain agriculture and water and sanitation in central Himalayan region. All
          these three themes are interconnected with the fragile of Mountain ecosystems which are always under threat
          from various disasters which affect these initiatives severely. Hence it becomes evidently impossible to
          visualize these initiatives in isolation with the frequently occurring disasters in the central Himalayas over
          past few decades. Hence Himmotthans post disaster relief, rehabilitation and livelihoods restoration programs
          were started in the year 2013.
